Create and activate the conda env with:
conda env create -f Sem2.yml
conda activate sem2_env

Then create a "Results" folder in the same folder where the test.py file is.

To change parameters go into the test.py file and in the function run_ef0() at the beginning the most importent parameters are listed, which you can edit. 


To run the code:
python3 test.py

The results are then saved in the resulting folder inside the Results folder.
